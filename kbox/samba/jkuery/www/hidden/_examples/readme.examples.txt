Examples
==========
These examples are not meant for everyone to just plug into production, but that may work for some
customers. While they will not harm your kbox they will not work for every customer's needs. 
Feel free to use them as you desire, whether that is as-is, with modifications or just as a proof of
concept /demo

Demos are not necessarily designed to work with one another.  For instance, an example that 
manipulates an OEM area of the kbox might trump another script trying to access that object. 
Reasonable effort has been made to make sure this does not happen, but no guarantees.

Demos are tested against the latest generation 5 browsers (chrome, ff, IE8+, safari, dolphin, some 
others, but may not be consistent).  One of the strengths of the recommended jQuery framework is 
its cross-browser compatibility is very high, but it is still not guaranteed

The only example shipped with jKuery 2.0 is aboutjKuery and there is more information about it 
available in the main \\k1000\jkuery folder. 

Additional demos are available. If you are running the chrome browser then you can download
a browser plugin that contains these demos. You can use these demos and integrate them into
your kbox if desired.  You do  not need jKuery installed to use the chrome plugin, but
it will look and feel as if it is installed. 

The chrome extension can be found here:
