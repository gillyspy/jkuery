Included Utilities:
=====================
none

Some suggestions for utilities:
==================================
- minifier: Either have a tool customer could run or perhaps force all code in the script 
directories through a minifier but leave "other", "markers" and utilities" untouched.  minifiers
are readily available online though  (http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/)
- jslint:  hard to write strict javascript through. Online tools available
- jsonlint: similar situation to jslint (http://jsonlint.com/)
- csslint: similar situation to jslint
- forums: appdeploy.com or itninja.com for specific jKuery and box help; stackoverflow.com is a good one for general javascript help (e.g.jQuery)  (http://www.appdeploy.com)  (http://www.itninja.com)
